# Biometrics-of-Human-Gait-Using-Kinect

Gait recognition is a type of biometric that has been widely worked in academic circles in recent decades. This is because the gait is one of the least invasive biometrics existing techniques, if not the lower. 


This paper aims to make a comparison between two versions of the Microsoft Kinect motion sensor, when used in the recognition of human walking.

All codes here were developed in Python and aims to get the raw data collected from both Kinect sensors (Kinect 360 and Kinect One), analyze them and return one arff file that will be analysed applying a KNN classifier.
